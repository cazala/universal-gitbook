# Universal Javascript


### Motivation 

The motivation to write this workshop came from the frustration that I found when I had to start working with React + Redux at work. I came from the AngularJS world, and suddenly I had to learn several new concepts and technologies like Webpack, Babel, PostCSS, React, Redux, Enzyme, Server-Side-Rendering, Isomorphic-Javascript, Hot-Module-Replace and a truckload of Other-Fancy-Buzzwords. It took me a while to get my head around this (I still am), and a lot of the documentation out there is still very poor... There are many seeds/starter repos that bring all the stuff together, but after cloning them I would find bigass configuration files which I had no idea how to use, and a lot of glue to hold all the pieces together... So I decided to go ahead and create a short tutorial, starting from scratch, and going thru all the steps from the `npm init` to having a working `universal-server-side-rendered-hot-reloading-isomorphic-react-redux-app`.

I hope someone else who's going thru the same pain of learning these tecnologies finds this useful.

You will need to be on a unix machine with `git` and `nvm` installed to be able to do this tutorial.
